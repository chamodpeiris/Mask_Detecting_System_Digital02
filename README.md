Mask-Aware Smart Camera Dolly with Real-Time Alerts (MASCARA)
(Arduino X OpenCV X TensorFlow)
The Mask-Aware Smart Camera Dolly with Real-Time Alerts (MASCARA) project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of detecting mask compliance in real-time and providing alerts when individuals are not wearing masks. The system leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and machine learning for real-time detection and utilizes a stepper motor for smooth camera movement. The system is designed to autonomously follow individuals while ensuring they wear masks, emitting warnings and transmitting in case of non-compliance.
Project Phases (Previously proposed):
	Phase 1: Hardware Setup and Basic Functionality (Arduino & Stepper Motor with webcam)
	Phase 2: Face and Body Tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe (Arduino & python)
	Phase 3: Mask Detection Integration with Machine Learning (Arduino & python)
